episode: 0 reward : 0.0 reformulated query leveraged buyouts wsj 870303 0099 your money matters partnerships open leveraged buyouts to individuals willing to take the risk by barbara donnelly special to the wall street journal 03 03 87 wall street journal j ire bsc efh tender offers mergers acquisitions tnm individual investors tantalized by stories of fabulous profits in the risky business of leveraged buyouts will be happy to know that wall street is opening avenues for them to participate alongside the big money players but skeptics warn that this is a sure sign that the big returns are a thing of the past in a leveraged buyout a group of investors buys a company and takes it private using mostly borrowed funds to finance the transaction cash flow and often asset sales are used to pay down the debt for investors the appeal is the prospect of a big return when the restructured company is refinanced or sold in a few years the transactions being put together for individual investors are limited partnerships that comprise an equity stake so called mezzanine financing privately placed junk bonds that usually include a small share in the equity or a combination of the two the partnerships generally project annual rates of return of about 30 on the equity stake and 20 on the mezzanine portion the minimums that those active in leveraged buyouts say are needed to make the risks worthwhile such potential rates of return based on the expected profit from selling the restructured company divided by the number of years the partnership is likely to own it are possible because of leverage consider a hypothetical company with a market value of 100 million that has 80 million of debt and 20 million of equity a 10 million reduction of debt or increase in value through better profit margins or growth will raise the value of its equity 50 to 30 million thus even modest financial improvements have a big impact on the value of the equity high returns are by no means certain however the company s future value hinges on economic developments that may be impossible to foresee in addition critics argue that leveraged buyouts mortgage a company s assets with no economic gain and substantially increased balance sheet risk for the company the tax law eases the burden somewhat because interest on the debt is deductible and if the buyout involves converting the company to a partnership from a corporation there is no more corporate income tax to pay profits are taxed only once as the investors personal income an added plus for some investors is that gains from the partnerships currently qualify as so called passive income that can be offset with passive tax shelter losses under the new tax law as the treasury continues to refine the definition of passive income however there s a risk it will rule that the gains are fully taxable ordinary investment income but leverage works both ways if a company involved in a buyout did do poorly equity investors who have last claim on the company s resources could quickly be wiped out in a recession for example a 10 reduction in the value of the hypothetical company would cut its equity in half investors who provide the mezzanine financing would fare somewhat better but even they could see the value of their investment vanish as the hard pressed company struggled to pay off bankers and other senior creditors who would have the first claim on its resources the first round of leveraged buyout partnerships is being aimed at a rather limited group of investors because most brokerage firm sponsors prefer to test the waters with private transactions for their wealthier more sophisticated customers only investors with net worths of 1 million or more and income of 200 000 can particpate in the private partnerships so far just one public leveraged buyout partnership has been offered equus investments i a diversified blind pool which means it isn t tied to predetermined transactions but is able to invest in those leveraged buyouts that come along the offering which required minimum investments of 5 000 2 000 for individual retirement accounts closed more than a year ago after raising 36 7 million only now however is it completing its first leveraged buyouts equus capital management corp the houston based investment company behind the partnership is currently offering a second one integrated resources inc a new york partnership sponsor plans four or five private offerings this year totaling 200 million it is currently arranging its first one an 80 million partnership

management firm closed a 31 2 million blind pool private partnership last year so far however the partnership which was sold in units of 500 000 has had trouble finding suitable buyouts oppenheimer amp co brought private investors into one of its leveraged buyouts for the first time last year and said the demand was overwhelming despite the 500 000 minimum stake meanwhile bear stearns amp co plans two private partnerships for very wealthy individuals and institutions one to invest in buyouts and another to provide bridge financing among the big retail brokers smith barney harris upham amp co painewebber inc and e f hutton amp co are all planning or considering leveraged buyout partnerships aimed at individuals for the firms the profit appeal of this type of product is clear fees can include a finder s fee of 1 to 3 of the cost of a leveraged buyout a 12 13 return on any financing the firm provides a 2 management fee and typically a 20 stake in any eventual capital gains that s not counting the 8 5 commission the brokers get for selling the partnership units for investors the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors among them too much capital chasing too few good candidates which has pushed costs up and returns down to what they see as unacceptable levels it may be a little late in the game to be attempting these deals and what we re seeing may be a typical case of the public getting in just before the bloodbath says david hunter head of direct investments at kidder peabody amp co which is one retail firm that decided against offering a leveraged buyout product to its investors still others insist opportunities exist for buyouts that offer attractive returns and acceptable risks endless divisions of big companies are being sold off and there are tons and tons of private companies anxious to do these deals

fin mutual and money market funds fnd leveraged buyout funds are proliferating and some people think that s good news for the stock market the biggest dissenters are the buyout financiers themselves who think the whole thing is getting out of hand james freeman an investment strategist at first boston corp estimates that investors are contributing about 17 billion to at least 27 such new funds through the power of leverage that translates into 140 billion in spending power he figures the vast majority of these purchases will be publicly traded stocks he says leveraged buyouts in which an investor group buys a company largely with debt and plans to pay the debt from the company s operations or sales of its assets have contributed significantly to the stock market s surge of the past few years such companies as beatrice lear siegler owens illinois and many others have been taken private in leveraged buyouts at premiums to their previous stock prices and many publicly traded stocks have risen in value on their possible appeal as buyout candidates once this additional freight train full of money starts rolling the next series of lbos is bound to spur overall equity prices mr freeman says or if the stock market should falter for technical reasons this money should underpin the market he says mr freeman does leave an out if fundamental economic conditions should worsen all that buyout money might not be spent but some of the biggest freight trains of buyout money are being driven with one hand on the brake it s a very pricey market lionel pincus a general partner in warburg pincus amp co a venture banking firm that is active in leveraged buyouts says that makes it a little more difficult to do things warburg pincus raised nearly 1 2 billion in a fund in february part of which can go for leveraged buyouts but mr pincus says the firm continues to be just as interested in other areas such as venture capital and providing cash infusions for ailing companies when you see people paying three times what a company is worth we don t want to play ted forstmann head of forstmann little amp co says having just amassed a 2 7 billion buyout fund mr forstmann insists that his chief objective is to make money for the investors he says equity partners have earned an average of 102 a year in forstmann s funds over the past 9 1 2 years but he says many other funds are in the game to make fees for themselves with the s amp p 400 industrials already selling at 24 times trailing earnings the question is how much farther the market can be driven up by a bunch of idiots trying to create fees by doing lbos mr forstmann says he has serious doubts that still more leveraged buyouts will have any significant bullish effect on the stock market investors in buyout funds generally are attracted by the extraordinary returns that leveraged buyouts have shown in recent years five years of recession free growth have helped earnings of the companies that conduct the buyouts while declining interest rates have cut their borrowing costs this in turn has brought big gains in valuations of these companies equity investors in leveraged buyout funds have often earned 60 to 100 a year and even subordinated debt investors have earned 20 to 40 but such favorable conditions are hardly likely to continue forever as a partner in charge of mergers and acquisitions at a major wall street firm notes this is a great time to raise lbo money he says but it s a terrible time to do deals mr pincus says he also is concerned about the glut of leveraged buyout money i wouldn

unsolicited by management and the considerably more numerous leveraged buyout firms which organize and invest in leveraged buyouts that generally are friendly to management to understand the significance of these developments one must recognize that the financial entrepreneur is a new kind of owner who did not exist in meaningful numbers until recently the american corporation traditionally has been owned by founder entrepreneurs their heirs or public shareholders the financial entrepreneur is a sophisticated participant in the capital markets using its resources to his advantage if he is a raider most often he is interested in the arbitrage between the acquisition value of the enterprise and the ultimate value of its parts the leveraged buyout artist on the other hand is most often a partner with management in acquiring and operating the enterprise he may finance the acquisition with junk bonds or he may do it privately with leading insurance companies and commercial banks within a year or two of acquiring control he may seek to raise new money in the public equity or debt markets the financial entrepreneur is not contributing only his own equity to his acquisitions the leveraged buyout firms in particular represent limited partnerships that are capitalized by america s leading insurance companies bank holding companies and the pension funds of major corporations and certain state employees the primary role of the financial entrepreneur is to allocate available capital to the enterprise he manages this process by holding management accountable for a business plan on which both have agreed if management cannot perform according to this plan and if as a consequence the viability of the enterprise is endangered by its financial leverage the financial entrepreneur is himself accountable to the corporation s creditors and to his own limited partners if the enterprise is successful the financial entrepreneur will share in its success through his ownership the financial entrepreneur then provides accountability for a long term plan one that the founder entrepreneur doesn t develop at least formally unless he has venture capitalists as investors and one for which the manager of a broadly owned publicly held company is not generally held accountable except through the price of his company s common stock the emergence of the financial entrepreneur is an important development because he represents an alternative form of ownership for the american company one that provides a longer term more professional view of capital allocation than is generally available through the board of a publicly held company because his investment horizon is often five years or more he offers management the time to plan and invest that it now says it doesn t have and because of his access to capital he offers companies the ability to grow those who decry takeovers and financial leverage should recognize that these three developments the availability of capital information and oversight are the very developments that investors of all stripes have been seeking within the capital markets for the most part those who engage in these activities are the agents of change in a post industrial economy as such they represent and are represented by most of the leading institutions that provide capital to american companies there are numerous examples of the positive changes that leveraged buyouts have brought the changes in the metal packaging industry offer good examples traditional participants in metal packaging packaging for beverages food paint and innumerable other substances deemed it a mature business segment during the 1970 s and used their excess cash not to invest in their existing businesses but to diversify american can went into specialty retailing and financial services continental can became continental group branching into forest products and insurance during the past four years at least four major metal packagers have been acquired through leveraged buyouts american can s packaging operations continental group national can co and the packaging division of sherwin williams now u s can co having either been bought out of the larger diversified parent or having leveraged and then shed unwanted parts each is now a company once again engaged primarily in manufacturing and marketing packaging the chief executive officer of one of these companies told me recently that when his company was public the annual rate of investment in new property plant and equipment was less than 60 of the rate of new investment under his management at another company management s commitment to new investment has led to more hourly jobs and important labor concessions making the company more competitive and enabling it to lower prices in my experience most leveraged buyouts are not about financial risk junk bonds or unwanted takeovers though one or all of these elements may be present instead they are about ownership which translates into dedication commitment focus and eventually a better company the financial entrepreneur is the facilitator of this phenomenon his access to capital and to information are his tools that much of the capital he employs is debt has not proved to be a restriction to development of the company for which he is accountable his role as an owner gives him considerable incentive to work with management to produce a success if congress s concerns about takeovers lead it to legislate restrictions on the use of high yield debt in takeovers it will be legislating against the activities of a new class of owner whose objectives are other than those of the relatively few highly publicized raiders consistent with managements stated objectives and who collectively have the ability to assist in the necessary evolution of our economy it will also be restricting the free movement of capital at the very time when it is most available to build the

reporter of the wall street journal 12 18 87 wall street journal j europ ba md aerospace aro monetary news foreign exchange trade mon executive exe washington talks between the u s and the european community over european government subsidies for airbus jet aircraft are deadlocked according to a senior reagan administration official the official who briefed reporters on the condition his name be withheld said the gulf between the u s and european positions on the issue is so great that the president s cabinet would consider in january whether even to continue talks on the issue he said there is little hope now of settling the issue unless top government officials decide to change the two sides positions the official said the u s may have to consider next month what to do if the talks don t get back on track he said the possibilities included filing an unfair trade practice complaint in the u s against airbus industrie the government subsidized consortium of british french german and spanish aircraft companies that competes with boeing co and mcdonnell douglas corp such a complaint could be filed either by the administration or by the u s industry the u s trade representative s office has been meeting with the europeans since october in an effort to resolve u s complaints that airbus is unfairly robbing sales from boeing and mcdonnell douglas the u s contends that massive european government subsidies to the consortium s four member firms permit it to sell planes at uneconomically low prices the europeans counter with claims that boeing and mcdonnell douglas also get subsidies indirectly through military contracts with the pentagon but the u s official said that washington can prove that the four members of airbus get as much or more help from military sales in addition to the outright subsidies for the commercial jet project airbus is a grouping of aerospatiale of france messerschmitt boelkow blohm g m b h of west germany british aerospace plc and construcciones aeronauticas s a of spain the talks have been going on in a very friendly fashion the u s official noted but he added it just so happens we are very far apart he charged that the reason we re not close is that the fundamental european position is that for airbus to survive it must have the right whether exercised or not to forever get a subsidy the airbus dispute he said has ballooned into the single most important trade issue between the u s and europe for the rest of the decade the administration decided to brief a few reporters on the issue partly to put pressure on

to the wall street journal 03 03 87 wall street journal j ire bsc efh tender offers mergers acquisitions tnm individual investors tantalized by stories of fabulous profits in the risky business of leveraged buyouts will be happy to know that wall street is opening avenues for them to participate alongside the big money players but skeptics warn that this is a sure sign that the big returns are a thing of the past in a leveraged buyout a group of investors buys a company and takes it private using mostly borrowed funds to finance the transaction cash flow and often asset sales are used to pay down the debt for investors the appeal is the prospect of a big return when the restructured company is refinanced or sold in a few years the transactions being put together for individual investors are limited partnerships that comprise an equity stake so called mezzanine financing privately placed junk bonds that usually include a small share in the equity or a combination of the two the partnerships generally project annual rates of return of about 30 on the equity stake and 20 on the mezzanine portion the minimums that those active in leveraged buyouts say are needed to make the risks worthwhile such potential rates of return based on the expected profit from selling the restructured company divided by the number of years the partnership is likely to own it are possible because of leverage consider a hypothetical company with a market value of 100 million that has 80 million of debt and 20 million of equity a 10 million reduction of debt or increase in value through better profit margins or growth will raise the value of its equity 50 to 30 million thus even modest financial improvements have a big impact on the value of the equity high returns are by no means certain however the company s future value hinges on economic developments that may be impossible to foresee in addition critics argue that leveraged buyouts mortgage a company s assets with no economic gain and substantially increased balance sheet risk for the company the tax law eases the burden somewhat because interest on the debt is deductible and if the buyout involves converting the company to a partnership from a corporation there is no more corporate income tax to pay profits are taxed only once as the investors personal income an added plus for some investors is that gains from the partnerships currently qualify as so called passive income that can be offset with passive tax shelter losses under the new tax law as the treasury continues to refine the definition of passive income however there s a risk it will rule that the gains are fully taxable ordinary investment income but leverage works both ways if a company involved in a buyout did do poorly equity investors who have last claim on the company s resources could quickly be wiped out in a recession for example a 10 reduction in the value of the hypothetical company would cut its equity in half investors who provide the mezzanine financing would fare somewhat better but even they could see the value of their investment vanish as the hard pressed company struggled to pay off bankers and other senior creditors who would have the first claim on its resources the first round of leveraged buyout partnerships is being aimed at a rather limited group of investors because most brokerage firm sponsors prefer to test the waters with private transactions for their wealthier more sophisticated customers only investors with net worths of 1 million or more and income of 200 000 can particpate

03 04 87 wall street journal j tender offers mergers acquisitions tnm securities industry scr congress cng as congress airs its concerns about the growing number of leveraged buyouts takeovers of public companies and the insider trading scandal policy makers and businessmen alike must deal with three major new influences in domestic capital markets first financial capital like other commodities is now in excess supply at the start of the decade as well as at the start of the 1970 s it was in short supply second the information revolution has enabled the performance of highly sophisticated financial in a very short period of time ten years ago an analysis such as the breakup value of a major corporation required an army of mbas today it can be done by an individual at home with a personal computer third as an outgrowth of the explosion of capital and the ability to analyze financial a new class of professionals has emerged the financial entrepreneurs this class includes two groups that might not enjoy being lumped together a small but highly publicized group of raiders the icahns and perelmans whose takeovers are generally unsolicited by management and the considerably more numerous leveraged buyout firms which organize and invest in leveraged buyouts that generally are friendly to management to understand the significance of these developments one must recognize that the financial entrepreneur is a new kind of owner who did not exist in meaningful numbers until recently the american corporation traditionally has been owned by founder entrepreneurs their heirs or public shareholders the financial entrepreneur is a sophisticated participant in the capital markets using its resources to his advantage if he is a raider most often he is interested in the arbitrage between the acquisition value of the enterprise and the ultimate value of its parts the leveraged buyout artist on the other hand is most often a partner with management in acquiring and operating the enterprise he may finance the acquisition with junk bonds or he may do it privately with leading insurance companies and commercial banks within a year or two of acquiring control he may seek to raise new money in the public equity or debt markets the financial entrepreneur is not contributing only his own equity to his acquisitions the leveraged buyout firms in particular represent limited partnerships that are capitalized by america s leading insurance companies bank holding companies and the pension funds of major and certain state employees the primary role of the financial entrepreneur is to allocate available capital to the enterprise he manages this process by holding management accountable for business plan on which both have agreed if management cannot perform according to this plan and if as a consequence the viability of the enterprise is endangered by its financial leverage the financial entrepreneur is himself accountable to the corporation s creditors and to his own limited partners if the enterprise is successful the financial entrepreneur will share in its success through his ownership the financial entrepreneur then provides accountability for a long term plan one that the founder entrepreneur doesn t develop at least formally unless he has venture capitalists as investors and one for which the manager of a broadly owned publicly held company is not generally held accountable except through the price of his company s common stock the emergence of the financial entrepreneur is an important development because he represents an alternative form of ownership for the american company one that provides a longer term more professional view of capital allocation than is generally available through the board of a publicly held company because his investment horizon is often five years or more he offers management the time to plan and invest that it now says it doesn t have and because of his access to capital he offers companies the ability to grow those who decry takeovers and financial leverage should recognize that these three developments the availability of capital information and oversight are the very developments that investors of all stripes have been seeking within the capital markets for the most part those who engage in these activities are the agents of change in a post industrial economy as such they represent and are represented by most of the leading institutions that provide capital to american companies there are numerous examples of the positive changes that leveraged buyouts have brought the changes in the metal packaging industry offer good examples traditional participants in metal packaging packaging for beverages food paint and innumerable other substances deemed it a mature business segment during the 1970 s and used their excess cash not to invest in their existing businesses but to diversify american can went into specialty retailing and financial services continental can became continental group branching into forest products and insurance during the past four years at least four major metal packagers have been acquired through leveraged buyouts american can s packaging operations continental group national can co and the packaging division of sherwin williams now u s can co having either been bought out of the larger diversified parent or having leveraged and then shed unwanted parts each is now a company once again engaged primarily in manufacturing and marketing packaging the chief executive officer of one of these companies me recently that when his company was public the annual rate of investment in new property plant and equipment was less than 60 of the rate of new investment under his management at another company management s commitment to new investment has led to more hourly jobs and important labor concessions making the company more competitive and enabling it to lower prices in my experience most leveraged buyouts are not about financial risk junk bonds or unwanted takeovers though one or all of these elements may be present instead they are about ownership which translates into dedication commitment focus and eventually a better company the financial entrepreneur is the facilitator of this phenomenon his access to capital and to information are his tools that much of the capital he employs is debt has not proved to be a restriction to development of the company for which he is accountable his role as an owner gives him considerable incentive to work with management to produce a success if congress s concerns about takeovers lead it to legislate restrictions on the use of high yield debt in takeovers it will be legislating against the activities of a new class of owner whose objectives are those of the relatively few highly publicized raiders consistent with managements stated objectives and who collectively have the ability to assist in the necessary evolution of our economy it will also be restricting the free movement of capital at the very time when it is most available to build the future of american business mr ferenbach is a general partner of berkshire

to the wall street journal 03 03 87 wall street journal j ire bsc efh tender offers mergers acquisitions tnm individual investors tantalized by stories of fabulous profits in the risky business buyouts will be happy to know that wall street is opening avenues for them to participate alongside the big money players but skeptics warn that this is a sure sign that the big returns are a thing of the a leveraged buyout a group of investors buys a and takes it private using mostly borrowed funds to finance the transaction cash flow and often asset sales are used to pay down the debt for investors the appeal is the prospect of a big return when the restructured company is refinanced or sold in a few years the transactions being put for individual investors are limited partnerships that comprise an stake so called mezzanine financing privately placed junk bonds that usually include a small share in the equity or a the two the partnerships generally project annual rates of return of about 30 on the equity stake and 20 on the mezzanine portion the minimums that those active in leveraged buyouts say are to make the such potential rates of return based on the expected profit from selling the divided by the number of years the partnership is likely to own it are possible because of leverage consider a hypothetical company with a market value of 100 million that has 80 million of debt and 20 million of equity a 10 million reduction of debt or increase in value through better profit margins or will raise the value of its equity 50 to 30 million thus even financial improvements have a big impact on the value of the equity high returns are by no means certain however the company s future value hinges on economic developments that may be impossible to foresee in addition critics argue that leveraged buyouts mortgage a company s assets with no economic gain and substantially increased balance sheet risk for the company the tax law eases the burden somewhat because interest on the debt is deductible and if the buyout involves converting the company to a partnership from a corporation there is no more corporate income tax to pay profits are taxed only once as the investors personal income an added plus for some investors is that gains from the partnerships currently qualify as so passive income that can be offset with passive tax shelter losses the new tax law as the treasury continues to refine the definition of income however there s a risk it will rule that the gains are fully taxable ordinary investment income but leverage works both ways if a company involved in a buyout did do poorly equity investors who have last claim on the company s resources could quickly be wiped out in a recession for example a 10 reduction the value of the hypothetical company would cut its equity in half investors who provide the mezzanine financing would fare somewhat better but even they could see the value of their investment vanish as the pressed company struggled to pay off bankers and other senior creditors who would have the first claim on its resources the first round of leveraged buyout partnerships is being aimed at a rather limited investors because most brokerage firm sponsors prefer to test the waters with private transactions for their wealthier more sophisticated customers only investors with net worths of 1 million or more

buyouts have shown in recent years five years of recession free growth have helped earnings of the companies that conduct the buyouts while declining interest rates have cut their borrowing costs this

tender offers mergers acquisitions tnm securities congress as congress airs its concerns about the growing number of leveraged buyouts takeovers of public companies and the insider trading scandal policy makers and businessmen alike must deal with three major new influences in capital markets first financial capital like other commodities is now in excess supply at the start of the decade as well as at the start of the 1970 it was in short supply second the information revolution has the performance of highly sophisticated financial analysis in a very short period of time ten years ago an analysis such as the breakup value of a major corporation required an army today it can be done by an individual home with a personal computer third as an outgrowth of the explosion of capital and the ability to analyze financial information a new class of professionals has emerged the financial entrepreneurs this class includes two groups that might not enjoy being lumped together a small but highly publicized group of raiders the icahns and perelmans whose takeovers are generally unsolicited by management and the considerably more numerous leveraged buyout firms which organize and invest in leveraged buyouts that generally are friendly to management to understand the significance of these developments one must recognize that the financial entrepreneur is a new kind of owner who did not exist meaningful numbers until recently the american corporation traditionally has been owned by founder entrepreneurs their heirs or public shareholders the financial entrepreneur is a sophisticated participant in the capital markets using its resources to his advantage if he is a raider most often he is interested in the arbitrage between the acquisition value of the enterprise and the ultimate value of its parts the leveraged buyout artist on the other hand is most often a partner with management in acquiring and operating the enterprise he may finance the acquisition with junk bonds or he may do it privately with leading insurance companies and commercial banks within a year or two of acquiring control he may seek to raise new money in the public equity or debt markets the financial entrepreneur is not contributing only his own equity to his acquisitions the leveraged buyout firms in particular represent limited partnerships that are capitalized by america s leading insurance companies bank holding companies and the pension funds of corporations and certain state employees the primary role of the financial entrepreneur is to allocate available capital to the enterprise he manages this process by holding management accountable for a business plan on which both have agreed if management cannot perform according to this plan and if as a consequence the viability of the enterprise is endangered by its financial leverage the financial entrepreneur is himself to the corporation s creditors and to his own limited partners if the enterprise is successful the financial entrepreneur will share in its success through his ownership the financial entrepreneur then provides accountability for a long term plan one that the founder entrepreneur doesn t develop at least formally unless he has venture capitalists as investors and one for which the manager of a broadly owned publicly held company not generally held accountable except through the price of his company s common stock the emergence of the financial entrepreneur is an important development because he represents an alternative form of ownership for the american company one provides a longer term professional view of than is generally available through the board of a publicly held company because his investment horizon is often years or more he offers management the time to plan and invest that it now says it doesn t have because of his access to capital he offers companies the ability to grow who decry takeovers and financial leverage should recognize that these developments the availability of capital information oversight are the very developments that investors of all stripes have been seeking within the capital markets for the most part those who engage these activities are the agents of change a post industrial economy as such they represent and are represented by most of the leading institutions that provide capital to american companies there are numerous examples of the positive changes that leveraged buyouts have brought the changes in the metal packaging industry offer good examples traditional participants in metal packaging packaging for beverages food paint and innumerable other substances deemed it a mature business segment during the 1970 s and used their excess cash not to invest in their existing businesses but to diversify can went into specialty retailing and financial services continental can became continental group branching into forest products and insurance during the past four years at least four major metal packagers have been acquired through leveraged buyouts american can s packaging operations continental group national can co and the packaging division of williams now u s can co having either been bought out of the larger diversified parent or having leveraged and then shed unwanted parts each is now a company once again engaged primarily in manufacturing and marketing packaging the chief executive officer of one of these companies told me recently that when his company was public the annual rate of investment in new property was less than of the rate of new investment under his management at another company management s commitment to new investment has led to more hourly jobs concessions making the company more competitive and enabling it to lower prices in my experience most leveraged buyouts are not about financial risk junk bonds or unwanted takeovers though one or all of these elements present instead they are about ownership which translates into dedication commitment focus and eventually a better company the financial entrepreneur is the facilitator of this phenomenon his access to capital and to information are his tools of the capital he employs is debt has not proved to be a restriction development the company for which he is accountable his role as an owner gives him considerable incentive to work with management to produce a success if congress s concerns about takeovers lead it to legislate restrictions on the use of high yield debt in takeovers it will be legislating against the activities of a new class of owner whose objectives are other than those of the relatively few highly publicized raiders consistent with managements stated objectives and who collectively have the ability to in the necessary evolution of our economy it will also be restricting the free movement of capital at the very time when it is most available to build the future of american business mr ferenbach is a general partner of berkshire partners a firm

consider in january to continue talks on the issue he said there is little hope now of settling the issue unless top government officials decide to change the two sides positions the official said the u s may have to consider next month what to do if the talks don t get back on track he said the possibilities included filing an unfair trade practice complaint in the s against airbus industrie the government subsidized consortium of british french german and spanish aircraft companies that competes with boeing co and mcdonnell douglas corp such a complaint could be filed either by the

sales from boeing and mcdonnell douglas the u s contends that massive european government to the consortium four member firms permit it to sell planes at uneconomically low prices the europeans counter with claims that boeing and mcdonnell douglas also get subsidies indirectly through military contracts with the pentagon but the u s official said can prove that the four members of airbus get

perelmans whose takeovers are unsolicited by management the considerably more numerous leveraged buyout firms which and leveraged that generally are to management understand the significance of these developments one must recognize that the financial entrepreneur new kind of owner who did meaningful numbers until recently the american corporation traditionally has been owned by founder entrepreneurs their heirs or public shareholders the financial a sophisticated participant in the capital markets using its resources to his advantage if he is a most often he is interested in the arbitrage between acquisition value of the enterprise and the ultimate value of its parts the leveraged buyout artist on the other hand is most often a partner with management in acquiring and operating the enterprise he may finance the with junk bonds or he may do it privately with leading commercial banks within a year or two of acquiring control he may seek to in the public equity debt markets the financial contributing only his own equity to his acquisitions the leveraged buyout firms in particular represent limited partnerships that are capitalized by america s leading insurance companies bank holding and the pension certain state employees primary role of the financial entrepreneur is to allocate capital enterprise he manages this process by holding management business plan on which both have agreed if management cannot perform according to this plan and if as a consequence the viability of the enterprise by its financial leverage the financial is himself accountable to the corporation s creditors and to his limited partners if the enterprise is successful the financial entrepreneur will share in its success through ownership the financial entrepreneur then provides accountability for a long term plan one that the founder entrepreneur doesn t develop at least formally he has venture capitalists as investors which the of a broadly owned publicly held company is not generally held except the price of his company s common stock the emergence of the financial entrepreneur an important development because he represents an alternative form of ownership for the american company one that provides a professional view of capital allocation than is generally available through the board of a publicly held company because his investment horizon is often five years or more he offers management time to plan invest that it now says it doesn t have and because of his access to capital he companies the ability to grow those who decry takeovers and financial leverage should recognize that these three developments the availability of capital information and are very developments that investors of all have been seeking within the capital markets the most part those

prices in my experience most leveraged buyouts are not about financial risk junk bonds or unwanted takeovers though all of these elements may be present instead they are about ownership which translates into dedication commitment focus and better company the financial facilitator of this phenomenon his access to capital and to information are his that much of the capital he employs is debt has not proved to be a restriction to development of the company for which he is accountable his role as an owner gives him considerable incentive to work with management to success if congress s
