ANT can directly read tarred gz or bz2 files since revision 510.

For UNIX-like operating systems, you have two options get the required libs linked with ANT.

(A) Option 1, use system default zlib and bzip2 libs

	(1) make sure your system has already the required libs installed.
		On Ubuntu 9.10, package zlib1g-dev and libbz2-dev have to be installed
	(2) enabling the following variables in makefile.unix
		USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB = 1
		USE_SYSTEM_BZLIB = 1
	(3) then 'make -f makefile.unix'


(B) Option 2, use built-in zlib and bzip2 libs
	(1) cd to ant/zlib, and untar zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
	(2) cd to zlib-1.2.3 and run 'configure' and 'make' (donot 'make install')
	(3) cd to ant/bzip, and untar bzip2-1.0.5.tar.gz
	(4) cd to bzip2-1.0.5 and run 'make' (donot 'make install')
	(5) enabling the following variables in makefile.unix
		USE_BUILT_IN_ZLIB = 1
		USE_BUILT_IN_BZLIB = 1
	(6) then 'make -f makefile.unix'
